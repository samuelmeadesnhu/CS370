Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The Treasure Hunter project utilized the Treasure Hunter ML gym, with starter code for the environment. The requirement was to
design an agent capable of efficiently learning/playing the Treasure Hunter game leveraging ML training strategies/algorithms. 


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists deliver software solutions accross a wide array of application. They are problem solvers who leverage knowledge
gathered to design and engineer a deliverable. Computer scientists play integral parts in the Software Development Life Cycle, designing
and implementing code leveraged in millions of products globally. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems wholistically considering foresight, efficiency, and ethics. Designing and producing code that
can withstand the test of time is an important trait in any developer. Writing code that optimizes delivery and runtimes is also a key component.
When considering complex software solutions, like AI/ML, it is important to heavily weigh the ethics of your work. Developing solutions with intent,
focussed on a deliverable and taking the time to comprehend the code through all aspects of the pipeline is a great position to analyze your work. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

The ethical responsibilities of developers are vast. Comprehending your code and its behavior is a core responsibility. This prevents developing 
code in a black box, and encourages more thorough audits/bug mitigation. Staying informed on trending security best practices is another
ethical issue that can protect both the developer and the organization.
